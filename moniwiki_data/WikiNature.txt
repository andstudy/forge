The WikiNature is typing in a bunch of book titles and coming back a day later and finding them turned into birds in the Amazon. 
Writing on Wiki is like regular writing, except I get to write so much more than I write, and I get to think thoughts I never thought (like being on a really good Free Software project, where you wake up the next morning to find your bugs fixed and ideas improved). 

It reminds us of minimalist Japanese brushstroke drawings; you provide the few, elegant slashes of ink, and other minds fill in the rest. 

It befuddles and enlightens. 

Really, it's not accurate to talk about a WikiNature, we would do better recognizing that Nature itself, is Wiki.
