Names of pages have to LookLikeThis. It's called a WikiName. If you write a word that LookLikeThis, it will be automatically turned into a link. More details about this you find on HelpForBeginners.

The following pages describe the elements (wiki markup) you can use to get special formatting effects:
 * HelpOnFormatting - general text formatting rules
 * HelpOnLinking - external hyperlinks and inline images
 * HelpOnHeadlines - section headings
 * HelpOnRules - horizontal rules
 * HelpOnLists - lists and indented sections
 * HelpOnTables - tables
 * HelpOnSmileys - how to insert a :)
 * HelpOnMacros - system macros
 * HelpOnProcessors - data processing scripts
 * HelpOnProcessingInstructions - how to influence page formatting
 * HelpOnXmlPages - how to store pages with XML content and process them via XSLT
 * HelpOnSubPages - how to group together related information

To experiment with wiki markup, go to the WikiSandBox and then click on "Edit''''''Text" at the bottom of the page. Use your browser's "open a new window with this link" feature on the word "WikiSandBox", so you can keep the help pages open side-by-side to the editing window.
