게임이름 : Telltale Games : Tales of Monkey Island

As a studio founded by LucasArts veterans, episodic gaming pioneer Telltale Games went back to its roots with Tales of Monkey Island. Telling a story over five chapters allowed the team to fill out the game's narrative but presented unique challenges to the art and production pipeline.

잘된 점
1. Telling a story in five chapters
2. Working with monkey island "Old timers"
3. The creation of a new cinematic director role
4. A good balance of old and new content
5. Strong art direction

아쉬웠던 점
1. The schedule was too close for comfort
2. Multiplatform development caused production traffic jams
3. Our "generic" pirates turned out to be too generic
4. Contorl scheme decisions were made at the last minute
5. We wanted every episode to be bigger and better than the last(Aka feature creep)
