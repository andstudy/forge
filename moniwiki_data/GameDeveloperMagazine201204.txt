Kingdoms of amalur : Reckoning

잘된 점
1. Combat - RPGs don't have to have boring fights
2. Usability testing - early and often
3. Functional groups - sitting together pays off
4. Scrum development methodology
5. EA partners - a great relationship

아쉬웠던 점
1. Preproduction - Entirely too short
2. Tools and pipelines - Laying down the track when the train is on its way
3. Demos - Too damn many of them
4. Main quest - not enough of it fleshed out early enough
5. Upper management shuffle
