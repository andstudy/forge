== Text Formatting Rules ==

Leave blank lines between paragraphs. Use {{{[[BR]]}}} to insert linebreaks into paragraphs.

You can render text in ''italics'' or '''bold'''.
To write italics, enclose the text in double single quotes.
To write bold, enclose the text in triple single quotes.
__Underlined text__ needs a double underscore on each side.
You get ^superscripted^ text by enclosing it into caret characters,
and ,,subscripts,, have to be embedded into double commas.

To insert program source without reformatting in a {{{monospace font}}}, use three curly braces:
{{{
10 PRINT "Hello, world!"
20 GOTO 10
}}}
Note that within code sections, both inline and display ones, any wiki markup is ignored. An alternative and shorter syntax for `inlined code` is to use backtick characters.

For more information on the possible markup, see HelpOnEditing.

=== Example ===
{{{
__Mixing__ ''italics'' and '''bold''':
 * '''''Mix''' at the beginning'' 
 * '''''Mix'' at the beginning'''
 * '''Mix at the ''end'''''
 * ''Mix at the '''end'''''

You might recall ''a''^2^ `+` ''b''^2^ `=` ''c''^2^ from your math lessons, unless your head is filled with H,,2,,O.

An {{{inline code sequence\}}} has the start and end markers on the same line. Or you use `backticks`.

A code display has them on different lines: {{{
'''No''' markup here!
\}}}
}}} 
/!\ In the above example, we "escaped" the markers for source code sequences by inserting \ character before the curly braces.

/!\ MoinMoin does not support escape "{''''''{{" markup in preblock.

=== Display ===
__Mixing__ ''italics'' and '''bold''':
 * '''''Mix''' at the beginning''
  * '' '''Mix''' at the beginning''
 * '''''Mix'' at the beginning'''
  * ''' ''Mix'' at the beginning'''
 * '''Mix at the ''end'''''
  * '''Mix at the ''end'' '''
 * ''Mix at the '''end'''''
  * ''Mix at the '''end''' ''

You might recall ''a''^2^ `+` ''b''^2^ `=` ''c''^2^ from your math lessons, unless your head is filled with H,,2,,O.

An {{{inline code sequence}}} has the start and end markers on the same line. Or you use `backticks`.


A code display has them on different lines: {{{
'''No''' markup here!
}}}

=== ColorizedSourceCode ===
Example:

{{{#!php
<?
phpinfo();
?>
}}}

== SixSingleQuotes and backticks ==
{{{
Wiki''''''Name vs Wiki``Name
}}}

Wiki''''''Name vs Wiki``Name
== MoniWiki extensions ==
To write --striked text--, enclose the text in double dashes.

Superscripted text also obtained by encloseing a string into double carets ^^like it^^.

/!\ MoinMoin does superscript texts contain space but, MoniWiki does not. You can superscript a string contains space by encloseing it into double carets.
