MoinMoin marks the InterWiki links in a way that works for the MeatBall:ColourBlind and also is MeatBall:LynxFriendly by using a little icon with an ALT attribute. If you hover above the icon in a graphical browser, you'll see to which Wiki it refers. If the icon has a border, that indicates that you used an illegal or unknown BadBadBad:InterWiki name (see the list above for valid ones). BTW, the reasoning behind the icon used is based on the idea that a Wiki:WikiWikiWeb is created by a team effort of several people.

See the wiki:MeatBall/InterWiki page on wiki:MeatBall:MeatballWiki for further details.
