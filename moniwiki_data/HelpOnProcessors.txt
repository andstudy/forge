== Processors ==

Processors work on the data in a code display. You specify which processor to call by using a ''bang path''-like construct in the first line. A bang path is a concept known from Unix command line scripts, where they serve the exact same purpose: the first line tells the shell what program to start to process the remaining lines of the script.

Similar to a parser, don't confuse them, see ["Parser"].

=== Colorize ===
The ColorizeProcessor knows of several source types, and can syntax-highlight them. For more information see ColorizeProcessor.

Example:
{{{#!php
<?
for ($i=1;$i<=100;$++)
  $sum+=$i;
?>
}}}
